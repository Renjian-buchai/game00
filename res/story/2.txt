Wednesday - Rainy

    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, they kissed! Finally! 

    Anyways, today, I pulled a 5* with 10 pity. That's all my luck for the month, gone. 

    Oh, right, speaking of months, I haven't updated this for one. Way too much happened last month. I drew a manga with my friend! It's a sack of shit, but at least it's our sack of shit. Probably shouldn't have done that during exam season. Not sure how I'm going to tell my parents about it, but I guess it's not my first time hiding stuff from them. 

    I don't know anymore. Why did I even bother drawing when I know I'd hide it anyways? I just can't bring myself to enjoy drawing. 

    Should've picked a better hobby. Maybe football? Or basketball? 

    I heard guys in sports clubs are popular. Maybe if I had been in one, she'd have accepted me? 

    Nevermind, I'm a halfhearted idiot anyways.
