    The last episode of 'I Was Reincarnated Into The Far Future And Fought The Demon King And Also Became A Mysterious Boy with Magical Powers That Have Never Been Seen Before! ~An Exciting Journey of Hot-Blooded Conquest, Bravery and Comradeship~' released today. Since it's the last episode, I said its full name instead of just calling 'Far Future' like I usually do.

    It's unexpectedly such a great anime. No matter what the haters say, there's definitely this insane sexual tension between Miyamoto and Iroha. MIroha ftw! Screw those HikaMoto shippers!

    I think that, my final review is 10/10. The deep emotional trauma experienced by characters in this anime have completely changed my worldview. The way the characters interact, and the deep emotions that the characters feel for each other are really incredible! Honestly, the best anime this season, especially since the Sawhand Person's ending is stupid.

    Maybe I'll stop here. I still have a lot of stuff I need to prepare. Maybe I can write the suicide note while I'm at it to save time?

    I guess so. Dad, Mummy, if you're reading this, goodbye? Idk, I still can't figure out what to write here. Anyways, love you. 

    Hopefully, this empty feeling goes away, and I'll just look back at this and laugh.
