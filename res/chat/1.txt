Bagel:Ah...
Bagel:It's been good here, too
Bagel:Speaking of, today, I spoke with a retard who was watching anime in public today
Bagel:It was so satisfying, exposing him as a pedophile for watching that 'loli' shit
Bagel:Really makes me wonder if we should just ban all anime here
aa:What're you talking about? 
aa:No???
ab:Haha, yeah.

Bagel:Really?
Bagel:Such a shame
Bagel:If I could, I would wipe out all of those from existence

Bagel:What're you on about?
Bagel:It literally has child characters in it
Bagel:It doesn't matter if it says they're 80,000 years old
Bagel:If someone's attracted to them, they're a pedophile
Bagel:So, this is basically child porn
Bagel:And if child porn doesn't support pedophilia, I don't know what does
Bagel:I don't know what happened to you
Bagel:You didn't use to be like this.
Bagel:Ah, something came up, so let's continue this next time.

Bagel:Such a shame
Bagel:Maybe we should start a campaign to get it removed from the internet
Bagel:That ought to keep pedophile numbers low
Bagel:Anyways, talk to you later, I guess.
